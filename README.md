# Tableau_HR_dashboard
This dashboard displays HR KPI metrics, is fully interactive, and has clickable icons and filters to explore the data. The dashboard has a dark theme, utilizes parameters and calculated fields, and shows a breakdown of employees by gender, education, job department, and hired/terminated status. The Departments and Location sections drill down the data even further than what is shown by having additional charts in the tooltip when you hover your mouse over the charts. For example, hover over any bar in the department's section to see which job titles are in that department and the total number of employees in each job. Click the "i" icon on the left side of the dashboard to see more information about how to use the dashboard. You can view the project online here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lexi.reed
